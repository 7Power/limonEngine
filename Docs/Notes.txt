1) Engine and content should be seperate
2) Engine should be develop for FPS game
3) A map editor should be developed too.
4) SDL2, Opengl4+GLEW and GLM would be used.
5) language choice is C++11
6) Build system choice is Cmake
5) Model format should be Collada or MD5, tbd.

TODO
1) Input should use callback functions when possible
2) vbo should not be exposed
3) We need a map editor using QT.
4) There should be some AI
5) Spot lights should be added.
6) Debug draw should be improved
	* Performance must be better. It is not working as it should right now
	* needs to have some other debug shapes, like sphere
	* Some cases might require a duration
7) There are points that does not use time provided by main loop. everthing should use it.
8) switching to game time required. or how are we going to pause the game?
9) a loading screen is needed. Right now if a map takes several seconds, only a white screen is shown
10) World definition should be moved to seperate file
11) For proper handling of opacity, we need to order the objects.
12) object culling? We are rendering everything, which is not feasible on the long run.
13) there should be a console like quake.
14) Options (like shadow res, screen res etc.) should be centralized
